# Wavomizer - Riding on a wave of success!

Yeah, so what to say about it? The word of the Global Game Jam 2017 was "waves", which resulted in this little fancy tower defense game, in which you have to answer waves of enemy with your own style of waves.

## How to play

Start, configure the volume settings in the options menu and play as far as you can. Will you survive the waves of several of creepy enemies?
Place your towers, which all send out some unique waves to harm your enemies and prevent them from infiltrating your base and dropping your life to zero.
Decide between the single-targeting Lightwave-Tower, which fires highly concentrated light at your enemies to tear them into pieces, the sound tower, which fires audio shockwaves to take your enemies from their feet and the water tower, which slows your enemies down by spilling water into their direction.
Each tower has unique abilities, ranges and strengths, and several enemies are immune to the one, but are weak to another at the same time. Will you figure out which tower combination is the best to stop your enemies and take revenge for the king?

But you guessed it, this isn't all, we wouldn't be "Team Ultra Lauch" if this would already be the best of it.

## Upgrade your towers in several ways

Each tower can be upgraded in strength, speed and shooting range respectively. Each of these upgrades costs money, but will you know when it's time to upgrade, or should you just buy a new one instead? What will be your choice of weapons?

## Platforms

This game supports Windows and Linux, both by using Python 2.7 and pygame libraries, as well as Bass4Py, a wrapper for the BASS library from un4seen.com. All those libraries are fully usable under Linux and Windows, maybe we could even try porting it for Mac OS, but you've guessed it, we only got 48 hours to finish...

By using cx_Freeze, the setup.py script in this repository generates a fully working executable including all related files and packs the whole game into a compressed file, absolutely made to share with your friends or upload to globalgamejam.org ;).

## Free to play

Since all games developed for, and while, the Global Game Jam fall under the Creative Commons License, you aren't just free of charge playing this game, I highly recommend you doing it, since it's really catchy and we really dripped some of our best swet into this piece of code.
Not to mention the loads of hours drawing the tiles and other pictures, or designing the sound effects or music.

## Development continues

After finishing the final version for the Global Game Jam competition, we decided to try and evolve this project into something bigger, something with more enemies, more towers, more maps and loads more fun.
Our designer wants to take more time to design all the small and big graphics included in our project, and at least there are several small bugs which want to be fixed, and many parts of the game aren't as flawless as we want them to be.
We're currently fixing up all these small things, adding an automated build system, and as soon as we think this game is ready for launch, you'll find a release for version 1.0 right here on this github page. Just stay tuned and expect much more content than in the GGJ Release, which can be found on globalgamejam.org.
